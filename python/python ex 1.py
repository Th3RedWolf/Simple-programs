#make sure you're consistent in how you name files.
#don't put any spaces in your file names, because that makes it hell to use with the command line.
#there's two main naming conventions you could use:
# 1. file_name.py (this is called snake case)
# 2. fileName.py (this is called camel case)
#whichever you use, use it consistently
